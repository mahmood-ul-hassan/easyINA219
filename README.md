# easyINA219
Easy to Use INA219 sensor library for AVR_iot_WG development board. But it can be used in any IDE with any MCU by making a small change in I2C related function
This library is ported from Arduino Adafruit_INA219.

EXAMPLE/ReadValue contain only main file for AVR_iot_WG microchip board.

HOW to use:
Generate AVR_iot_WG project using https://start.atmel.com/
Replace or Modified the generated main.c file with example main.c file.
Include easyINA219.c and easyINA219.h in generated project
Connect INA219 breakout board with microchip board.
Build and load :)
